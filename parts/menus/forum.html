		Hello,<br><br><br>


		You can now get verified on forum.<br><br>

		The way it's gonna work is that you can send me a PM with a verification picture. The picture has to contain you and forum name on piece of paper or on your body and your username or my username instead of the website name, if you prefer that.<br><br>

		I need to be able to recognize you in that picture. You need to have some pictures of your self in your gallery so I can compare that picture.<br><br>

		Please note that verification is completely optional and it won't give you any extra features or access. You will have a check mark (as I have now, if you want to look) and verification will only mean that you are who you say you are.<br><br>

		You may not use a fake pictures for verification. If you try to verify your account with a fake picture or someone else picture, or just spam me with fake pictures, you will get Banned!<br><br>

		The pictures that you will send me for verification won't be public<br><br><br>


		Best regards,<br><br>

		StanleyOG.<br>
